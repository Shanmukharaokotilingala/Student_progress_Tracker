#  STUDENT PROGRESS TRACKER SYSTEM
The **ATM Management System** is a console-based Python mini project developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** concepts. This project simulates basic ATM operations such as checking account balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, and viewing account details through a simple menu-driven interface. The system uses classes and objects to represent real-world banking entities, applies encapsulation to protect account data, and uses inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism to organize and reuse code effectively. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit, making it easy to perform multiple transactions in one session. This project helps students understand how OOPS concepts can be applied in Python to build real-life applications in a structured and efficient manner.
